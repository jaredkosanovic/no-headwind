This is the first of several parts summarizing my experience with Bike Nonstop US, a 3,500 mile, mixed terrain race across the United States.
Unlike my journal of last year's tour, Bike Nonstop summaries will be separated by region, with Oregon deserving of its own post for reasons that will hopefully be obvious.

## Pre-Race

Tensions were high as weather forecasts started to accurately predict the weather I would experience riding through Oregon.
Record breaking temperatures were anticipated, ramping up shortly before the race left Portland the morning of July 27th, 2021.
This heat wave was so intense, unusual, and unfortunetly fatal for many in the western United States that [it has a Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Western_North_America_heat_wave).

Trying to avoid dehydration, I made some last minute gear changes, swapping my 48 oz Nalgene for a 40 oz insulated Hydroflask that could keep ice cold all day.
Additionally, I added a 70 oz Platypus soft bottle.

The evening before the start, racers and the race director met at a bar in Portland to distribute GPS trackers, and agree on a start time.
It was 108°F outside (an all-time record for Portland) and couldn't have been more than 15 degrees cooler than that inside.
Being a newer and lesser known race, there were only 11 racers but the comraderie was high from the beginning.
This will be a recurring theme throughout my posts: The people.
People were one of the main highlights of this experience, including the other racers, dot watchers (people who watch our GPS tracks), and total strangers.

The race was originally scheduled to depart at 6:00 AM the next morning but we all agreed to move it to 5:00 AM instead.
In retrospect, this likely didn't make much of a difference, and I would soon learn that it was necessary to start each day of riding much earlier.

## The Race Begins

My original goal was to make it to Fossil, OR on day one, which would've been about 175 miles with a good chunk of climbing.
With the weather forecast, I adjusted expectations and aimed for Maupin, OR instead, a little over 110 miles from the start.

The route for the first installment of this race in 2019 had racers leave Portland and join the [Cascading Rivers Scenic Bikeway](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/road-biking/cascading-rivers-scenic-bikeway/).
Wildfires in 2020 have left most of that route closed ever since, requiring a route change to stay closer to Mount Hood.

I enjoyed climbing Still Creek Road, which was a beautiful single lane forest road close to Mount Hood, with abundant shade and sounds of running water.
Being the start of the race, many of the racers were riding together or frequently leap-frogging each other.
Later on highway 214, I passed signs for a fire that had broken out a week before.
Fortunetly, fire crews quickly had the fire under control and a reroute wasn't needed.

Shaded, high-elevation terrain soon descended into the exposed, high-desert landscape of central Oregon.
The sudden increase in temperature felt like a giant hair dryer, a phrase frequently used by other racers.

Descending further into Maupin, where the high was 115°F that day, I resupplied before arriving at a lodge that another racer had offered to share with anyone who could make it.
It was the mid-afternoon and I was content with staying in Maupin until it cooled down.
Only two other racers continued beyond Maupin that afternoon with one of them turning around due to even hotter temperatures reported on the big climb appropriately named Bakeoven Road.

What better way to pass the time than to meet up with my Dad to swim in the Deschutes River and eat dinner together at a restaurant.
He had ridden his motorcycle from Corvallis, OR that day and was spending the night in a nearby hotel.
Although I felt physically good at this point, during dinner I was starting to realize effects of heat that I never have before.
My appetite wasn't all there.
It was taking me a little longer to eat food than usual and I ate less than I think I needed.
Another effect of the heat was on my sleep.
It was hard to go to sleep, which was frustrating since I was planning to leave at 2:00am with another racer in order to get to Mitchell, OR before too late in the day.

The ride from Maupin to Fossil the next morning was stunning. Big views, big climbs, minimal traffic, and hot but manageable temperatures.
I caught up to several other racers in Fossil, who had left Maupin in the evening the previous day.
After a critical resupply in Fossil, five of us left around the same time and headed towards Mitchell to experience what was the most challenging section of the entire race from my point of view.
It was still the morning but already hot.

After another mountain pass, I descended into the rural community of Twickenham along the John Day River.
I was reminded of the hair dryer effect of yesterday's descent into Maupin, but much worse, and much earlier in the day.
I caught up with another racer who was enjoying enjoying the shade of a restroom next to a boat launch.
Some rafters had left a pile of unneeded ice next to the river, so I loaded some into my neck buff and arm sleeves.
The river seemed a little questionable to filter, and I felt good about the remaining water I had to get me to Mitchell.

A couple other racers caught up to us with one of them reporting a spigot close to the road a half mile back.
I went back to top off my bottles and drink a lot directly from the spigot.
It felt good knowing I was carrying as much water as I could, with the temperature still increasing.

Four of us continued towards Mitchell where the road changed to gravel and ascended on one of the steeper sections of the day in the hot, exposed sun.
Being next to the [Painted Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_Hills), I was really looking forward to the section of this route.
I don't think I remember seeing a single painted hill that day.
It was just too hot.
My mind was focused on moving forward, fast enough but being careful to take breaks often.

A ranch worker pulled over and gave us some cold waters and Powerades.
We took frequent breaks in the shade on the side of the road, about every 10 minutes, since the road itself was entirely exposed.
Nearby farm sprinklers provided brief but needed solace as the heat was just destroying us.

We eventually came across a person and his dog who had a small but welcoming campground setup on the side of the road.
He offered us water.
I still had plenty, but it was almost too hot to drink with the exception of the ice water in the Hydroflask that I was rationing.
He said it was temperature outside was 115°F in the shade and 125°F in the sun.

All my food was liquified.
Another racer's sunglasses had melted.

We eventually joined the highway and climbed a few miles to the Spoke'n Hostel in Mitchell, a donation-based hostel for travelling cyclists.
In the distance, I could see people out in the road with cowbells, cheering us on as we arrived at the hostel.
This is a tradition of the hostel, with workers and guests tracking the GPS locations of racers as they climb up the highway.
Cold glasses of water and popsicles were at the ready.

I arrived first in our group of four and took some pictures of others arriving.
I was likely still running on adrenaline at this point, since a better choice would've been to go inside and recover in the air conditioned basement.

After showering and heading to the basement, my body caught up with me.
I had never felt so destroyed in this way.
My appetite was completely gone.
I sipped on some chocolate milk to get some calories down.
That day was not sustainable and just objectively unhealthy.

The Spoke'n Hostel could not have been a better way to end what was the dangerously hot day.
The hospitality and kindness of the workers there was nothing short of excellent.
Laundry, beds, shower, plenty of food, bike tools, and everything a travelling cyclist could ever want.
I encourage readers to [check out the Spoke'n Hostel's website to learn more and make a donation if you are able to](https://www.spokenhostel.org/).
 
I left the next morning around 2:00 AM with a plan to make it to Prarie City, OR, a little over 80 miles away.
With a Hydroflask full of ice and chocolate milk, I left the hostel made it to Prarie City a little after 10:00 AM where it was already in the low 90s.
It was a much needed short and uneventful day, despite still feeling destroyed and running on little sleep.
Another burst of hospitality came from the Hotel Prarie in Prarie City, who let me check in early and offered rags and a hose to clean my bike.

I tried to rest during the day but was only able to get in a couple hours of sleep.
As night fell, I was still awake and noticed another racer leaving Prarie City.
I decided to postpone sleep, pack up, and hit the road around 11:00 PM.




I had a compelled last minute change in bike choice, which is rarely a good situation to be in before a bike race, especially one of this length and difficulty.
After flying into Oregon almost 3 weeks before the start of the race, I opened my bike carrier and discovered a full separation in the frame of my 2016 GT Grade at the seatstay bridge.
I'm not sure when this damage occurred. It might've been there previously and I didn't notice, but in any case, I couldn't undo it so I had to figure out how to move forward.
This is the same bike I rode from Madison, WI to Corvallis, OR the year before, and Strava tells me it has over 20,000 miles on it.
It lived a good life, but I was a bit worried about finding a new bike, being this close to the start date of the race, let alone being comfortable riding it for 3,500 miles.

I was relieved to find a last-resort option in case I needed it: My father in-law's custom Independent Fabrications steel touring bike.
It would fit me and would be a decent option for the event.

That being said, I needed a new bike anyway, so I looked online for local bike shops that had something in stock.
My criteria for a new bike was the following:

- It had to fit me. I usually ride a 60 cm frame or whatever the manufacturer thinks is XL.
- It had to be practical for normal riding, not just something suited only for this race. Thankfully, the route incorporated a lot of road, gravel, and rail trails, which is my normal riding preference anyway.
- It had to be ready before the race!

After some searching, River City Bicycles in Portland, OR had a bike in stock that fit my criteria, with a little extra money on top to expedite the build since it was still in a box in their warehouse.
Here are some of the specifications after I made it ready for the race.

## Reflections

### Improving Upon Last Year's Tour

One of my goals for this race was to improve upon some of the drawbacks of my tour last year, which I feel I succeeded in.

Some hand numbness and hands falling asleep while riding was primarily addressed by getting a bike fit as well as using gel gloves.
The addition of aero bars was also extremely helpful, allowing me to give my hands a break while riding.
I had my bike fit done by Cronometro in Madison, WI on my GT Grade earlier in 2021.
I had saved all the measurements and changes to my phone, and spent hours trying to replicate those measurements to my new bike in the couple weeks before the race.
I'm happy to report that after 3,500 miles of biking, I have zero numbness in my fingers and hands.

Another issue from last year was being uncomfortable on the saddle over long distances.
The bike fit helped a lot with this, but I took some additional steps to ensure my butt would be more comfortable, or as comfortable as it can be with riding so much every day.
Chamois cream and a new saddle were extremely helpful.
I also used two different brands of bib shorts to alternate from day to day.
Given all these changes, my butt situation was much better than last year, although not perfect.

The last item I intended to address was the mental fatigue from dealing with traffic all day.
This one is harder to improve, but I took some steps that ended up being helpful.
Despite making me appear much older than I am, a rear-view mirror mounted on my glasses was the best way I addressed my issue with traffic.
Being able to see traffic from behind move over before they pass, without needing to turn my head constantly, provided relief on the busier sections of the route.
No longer do I have to hope that cars will give me space as they pass me.
I can better see what cars are doing and try to take action if needed before they pass.
I'm not saying a mirror will make cyclists safer, but for myself, it eased the stress of dealing with traffic.

I also used a Garmin Varia radar taillight which connects to my phone and alerts me if a car is approaching from behind.
This was especially helpful in areas with a lower volume of traffic, since I could bike anywhere in the lane of the highway until a car was approaching from behind, at which point I would move to the shoulder until it passed.

Of course, the best way to deal with traffic is to avoid it entirely, and the route for this race did a good job with that given its length.
There were many rail trails, especially in the east, where no motor vehicles are allowed.
The route also seemed to gravitate towards more backroads, even if that meant a hillier route or riding on gravel that limits speeds to single digits (or both!).
Rough gravel with no cars beats a smooth highway with traffic, any day.

### What Worked Well

My overall bike setup worked extremely well.
Huge thanks to River City Bicycles in Portland, OR for doing a flawless build.
I never had to adjust shift cables, brakes, or anything on the ride.
The Otso Waheela ended up being a much better bike for this race than I believe my GT Grade would've been.
I used every single gear combination on the bike for this route, given the broad mix of flat highways, steep climbs, and rough gravel.
My GT Grade's lowest gear was a 36t/32t and I'm very happy I had easier gears than that on the Waheela.
My old bike also wouldn't comfortably fit tires wider than 32c, so I'm happy that I was able to run wider tires on the Waheela.

The slick tire tread worked well, too.
I never felt at a loss for traction, even on the wet gravel sections.
The additional benefits in rolling resistance on the pavement seemed to outweigh any losses in traction on the dirt.

My hydration setup also worked great.
Despite being heavy, the Hydroflask was an effective way to cool off since it could keep ice frozen all day.
I would fill it entirely with ice and then fill the rest with water, and replenish it throughout the day with my other water between resupply points.
This was especially helpful in the west with longer distance between services and hot Oregon weather.
The Oregon heat had the effect of making it hard to eat solid food, so for a couple days, I filled the Hydroflask with 40 oz of chocolate milk to aid in calorie consumption.

The neck buff and arm sleeves were helpful for sun protection in addition to keeping me cool.
I would frequently soak them in water when I had the opportunity.
It also allowed me to use less sunscreen and spend less time applying sunscreen.

### What Didn't Work Well

Fortunately there isn't much to report in this section.
I did have some issues with flat tires though, to the point of using all my spare tubes and almost all my patches.
Most of the flats occurred in Nebraska due to thorns that were hard to spot while riding.
My tubeless setup wasn't able to seal any of the punctures I got, making me conclude that it performed just as well as when I had to resort to tubes.

### What To Do Differently

Continuing on my issues with punctures, I think one way to improve this would be to run wider tires with lower pressures.
I've found that tubeless works better with lower pressures in its ability to seal punctures.
I think that using a 38c or 40c tire instead of the 35c I used would've helped with this.
A different sealant choice would be worth trying as well.

If I were to do a race like this again, I would need to figure out a faster way to charge all my electronics.
A wall charger with more USB ports would help with charging more things simultaneously.
I would sometimes wake up halfway through my sleep to swap which electronics were on the charger.
A few racers were using dynamo hubs to keep things charged while moving, and I think this would've been a good option had I been spending more time on the bike.
It was a challenge to keep everything charged.

My phone worked well for navigation but when it rained, it was mostly unusable with water on the screen.
I would use my Apple Watch in these situations, but I think a better option would be a dedicated bike computer.

I likely could've mailed more gear home as I traveled eastward, such as my sleeping bag.
It did come in handy though when I camped in Stanley, ID and it got down to 42°F, which felt extra cold after being in 100°F+ temperatures the day before in Oregon.

Finally, no need for a razor. I ended up using it a couple times, if only to justify it to myself for carrying it.

## Summary

I'm overall very happy with my choice of bike and gear, which I attribute partly to luck and partly to intentional preparations.
I definitely didn't have the lightest setup among the other racers and would like to lighten the load in the future, but I ended up using every piece of gear I brought and didn't feel the weight was ever a significant drawback.
