This year, I’m participating in [Bike Nonstop](https://bikenonstop.com/), which is a 3,500 mile mixed terrain bike race across the United States.
I did this same event last year, but I’m back for round two.
I feel like I can beat my time from last year and I like the idea of riding a familiar route.
Besides being familiar, the route itself is a great way to traverse the country because it uses a lot of cycling infrastructure.

Similar to last year, I’ll also be fundraising.
I’m fundraising for ShelterBox this year to provide aid to the crisis in Ukraine.
ShelterBox helps provide shelter and tools to families who have been made homeless due to disaster and conflict.
Millions of people have been forced to leave their homes in Ukraine and aren’t able to flee the country due to compromised transportation and infrastructure, financial constraints, and the danger of the war around them.
ShelterBox is actively providing resources to help those people who are in Ukraine without homes. My goal is to raise $1 for every mile of my bike race: $3,500 total.

Follow [this link to donate to my fundraiser](https://givebutter.com/SBUSA/jaredkosanovic).
Please consider donating and designating your donation to the Ukraine Crisis using the drop-down menu.

Learn [more about ShelterBox here](https://www.shelterboxusa.org/home-page/about/).

Bike Nonstop is a self-supported event, meaning that I can’t accept any food, water, or shelter that isn’t commercially available to all the other riders.
You can follow my progress by using the map below or by [going to this link](https://trackleaders.com/bikenonstop22).
The race director has also developed a mobile app that allows riders to share photos and videos from along the route.
The app also shows rider locations based on their cell phone location, but in most cases, the map below will be more accurate since it’s based on our dedicated GPS trackers.

I’m looking forward to seeing the country from my bike again, meeting some locals, and finding my mental and physical limits.
I’m excited to see what can come as a result of all the preparations and tweaks I’ve made from last year.
Wish me luck!
