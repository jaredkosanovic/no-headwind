I just finished Bike Nonstop US, a 3,500 mile, mixed terrain race across the United States.
Here I will share details about the gear and bike I used for the event, and some reflections on the choices I made.

## Bike

I had a compelled last minute change in bike choice, which is rarely a good situation to be in before a bike race, especially one of this length and difficulty.
After flying into Oregon almost 3 weeks before the start of the race, I opened my bike carrier and discovered a full separation in the frame of my 2016 GT Grade at the seatstay bridge.
I'm not sure when this damage occurred. It might've been there previously and I didn't notice, but in any case, I couldn't undo it so I had to figure out how to move forward.
This is the same bike I rode from Madison, WI to Corvallis, OR the year before, and Strava tells me it has over 20,000 miles on it.
It lived a good life, but I was a bit worried about finding a new bike, being this close to the start date of the race, let alone being comfortable riding it for 3,500 miles.

I was relieved to find a last-resort option in case I needed it: My father in-law's custom Independant Fabrications steel touring bike.
It would fit me and would be a decent option for the event.

That being said, I needed a new bike anyway, so I looked online for local bike shops that had something in stock.
My criteria for a new bike was the following:

- It had to fit me. I usually ride a 60 cm frame or whatever the manufacturer thinks is XL.
- It had to be practical for normal riding, not just something suited only for this race. Thankfully, the route incorporated a lot of road, gravel, and rail trails, which is my normal riding preference anyway.
- It had to be ready before the race!

After some searching, River City Bicycles in Portland, OR had a bike in stock that fit my criteria, with a little extra money on top to expedite the build. Here are some of the specifications after I made it ready for the race.

- Frame: Otso Waheela C
- Crankset: Shimano GRX, 48/31t
- Cassette: Shimano, 11 speed, 11-34t

- Tires: Panaracer GravelKing Plus (slick), 700x35c, tubeless
- Brakes: Shimano GRX Hydrualic Disc Brakes
- Saddle: Fizik Tempo Argo R5, 160mm
- Pedals: Shimano SPD
- Aero Bars: Profile Designs Sonic Ergo 4252a with 50mm risers
- Phone Mount: Quad Lock Out Front

## Reflections

### Improving Upon Last Year's Tour

One of my goals for this race was to improve upon some of the drawbacks of my tour last year, which I feel I succeeded in.

Some hand numbness and hands falling asleep while riding was primarily addressed by getting a good bike fit as well as using gel gloves.
I had my bike fit done by Cronometro in Madison, WI on my GT Grade earlier in 2021.
I had saved all the measurements and changes to my phone and spent hours trying to replicate those measurements to my new bike in the couple weeks before the race.
I'm happy to report that after 3,500 miles of biking, I have zero numbness in my fingers and hands.

Another issue from last year was being uncomfortable on the saddle.
The bike fit helped a lot with this, but I took some additional steps to ensure my butt would be more comfortable, or as comfortable as it can be with riding so much every day.
Chamois cream and a new saddle were extremely helpful.
I also used two different brands of bib shorts to alternate from day to day.
Given all these changes, my butt situation was much better than last year, although not perfect.

The last item I intended to address was the mental fatigue from dealing with traffic all day.
This one is harder to improve, but I took some steps that ended up being helpful.
Despite making me appear much older than I am, a rear-view mirror mounted on my glasses was the best way I addressed my issue with traffic.
Being able to see traffic from behind move over before they pass, without needing to turn my head constantly, provided relief on the busier sections of the route.
No longer do I have to hope that cars will give me space as they pass me.
I can easily see what they're doing, and take action if needed before they pass.
I'm not saying a mirror will makes cyclists safer, but for myself, it eased the stress of dealing with traffic.

I also used a Garmin Varia radar taillight which connects to my phone and alerts me if a car is approaching from behind.
This was especially helpful in areas with a lower volume of traffic, since I could bike anywhere in the lane of the highway until a car was approaching from behind, at which point I would move to the shoulder until it passed.

Of course, the best way to deal with traffic is to avoid it entirely, and the route for this race did a good job with that.
There were many rail trails, especially in the east, where no motor vehicles are allowed.
The route also seemed to gravitate towards more backroads, even if that meant adding in a giant hill or riding on gravel that limits speeds to single digits.
Rough gravel with no cars beats a smooth highway with traffic, any day.
