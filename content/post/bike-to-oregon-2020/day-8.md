Similar to yesterday, I had to make some choices today about whether I wanted a shorter day or a longer one, with the towns being small far between.
The wind and weather forecast teased me to take another shorter day, but I wanted to keep my progress going.
I aimed for Bismarck which was 111 miles away taking the Northern Tier route.
The route dips down south, goes west, and then goes north again to get to Bismarck.

Since most of North Dakota’s roads are in a grid with no mountains to get around, I noticed a gravel road continuing directly west at the 90 degree turn where the route suggested to go south.
It was tempting taking the shortcut, but I opted to stay on the route given my previous experience with a gravel road on the eastern side of the state.
The Northern Tier route seemed to always avoid gravel, likely to cater to a majority of the bike tourers in addition to the fact that paved roads pass through more towns.

I left early that day, but the wind got an early start as well, blowing from the north and later coming out of the northwest.
The tailwind was short lived as I took the jaunt down south, as the rest of the day was battling the most brutal crosswind I’ve ever experienced.
I knew I was in for a long day, pedaling on flat roads in my climbing gear and leaning into the crosswind to stay balanced.
Luckily, traffic was low.
The scenery did offer some enjoyment.
I saw fewer cornfields and more grassy plains with lots of cattle grazing.
This was the first time in the trip where the wind was so strong that the sheer sound of it drowned out any music or podcast I was listening to, forcing me to pay full attention to the environment around me.

As I was getting closer, I wasn’t feeling ready to return to tent camping life.
I made another text to Abbey requesting a hotel, and she immediately responded with reservation details.
There wasn't much else to remember from this day, other than I was driven to get it over with.

I was still having fun though, and I was noticing my physical condition improving.
It didn’t hurt as much to sit down.
I was focusing more on the angle of my wrists so that my hands wouldn’t lose sensation.

I arrived at my hotel room and did my usual routine of laying out all my gear throughout the room and jumping in the shower.
Being in a bigger city, I had access to more food delivery options.
I ordered two burritos and one burrito bowl from Qdoba, thinking that I could have the burrito and burrito bowl for dinner and then save the second burrito for breakfast in the morning.
I must’ve been even hungrier than that after biking 111 miles against the wind, since I ate all three items in one sitting.

Later on, I had a Facetime call with Abbey, my brother in law, and his girlfriend for a game night.
I told them how much I just ate and Abbey knew me well enough to suggest I should get even more food.
There was a McDonald's next to the hotel which sounded good, so I said I’d be right back and walked to get some dessert.
I brought a McFlurry, apple pie, and sprite back to my room and ate it all.
It was fun playing games and it kept my loneliness at bay.
