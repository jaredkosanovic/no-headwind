## Day 1

The first day of the trip started with my wife, Abbey, making me french toast for breakfast.
Abbey joined me on her bike for the first 20 miles of my day.
The goal was to make it to Wilton, WI for the night which was a little over 100 miles away.
Almost half of the day would be rail trails, which former railways that have been converted into trails, absent of cars.

20 miles from home, Abbey and I said goodbye on the side of a farm road next to a corn field, a fitting goodbye for the midwest.
She turned around and I kept going.
I had been planning to stay at a city campground in Wilton, but I learned when I arrived that it had been closed due to COVID.
This was easily preventable, but I'm glad I learned this lesson early in my trip where it was easier to find alternative campsites.

My first priority was to get some food, so I called a local bar to order a pizza.
I biked to get my pizza and decided to eat inside and distance myself from the few other crowds.
People were friendly, and one person started asking about what brought me to town.
I told her that I was biking across the country.
I mentioned my poor campsite planning and that I was originally planning to stay at the town campground before learning it was understandably closed.
She immediately offered her backyard for me to use as a campground for the night.

When she told her boyfriend about my trip, he offered his backyard too.
Both were locals.
I looked up their addresses on google maps and chose the boyfriend's house due to the bigger backyard.

Not how I was planning to spend the first night of my trip, but I was grateful for the kindness I was already experiencing.
