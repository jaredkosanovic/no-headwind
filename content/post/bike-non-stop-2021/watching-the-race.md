On June 27th, I'm beginning a cross-country bike race from Portland, OR to Washington D.C.
This post contains resources for following along with the race.
As part of my participation, I'm fundraising to help end Polio.
Take a look at my [previous post for more details](../introduction) and please consider [donating to my fundraiser](https://raise.rotary.org/jaredkosanovic/challenge).

## Dot Watching

Every racer has a GPS tracker sending their location to a map on a regular basis.
Follow along on the map and look out for my initials, "JK".

After the race, I'm planning to make some posts on this blog.
